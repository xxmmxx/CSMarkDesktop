# Roadmaps

## CSMark 1.0 Overall Roadmap

### Name
CSMark 1.0

### Targeted Release Date/Time Frame
2018 or 2019.

### Completed Features
* __A better Scoring System__ - Already achieved as of 0.26.0 . Improved upon further in subsequent 0.x releases.

### Work In Progress Features
* __Increasing viability as a Benchmark for use in Reviews__ by providing a more stable, usable and feature rich application that is intuitive and easy to use. Reviewers and individuals wanting to test CPUs need a reliable product to confidently say how specific CPUs perform. Using an unstable benchmark or a constantly changing benchmark means that mistakes could be made and/or it could lead to inaccurate findings. This needs to be avoided at all costs and stability is of the utmost importance.
* __Making it more visually appealing for most users__ . Normal users might use CSMark if they found out from a reviewer information about it or want to compare the reviewer's score with their own CPU.
If normal users are going to use this application, it needs to be available on more platforms in different versions. A Console Application is perfectly usable for power users and those who are generally comfortable using PCs.
The problem arises for casual users or non-power users who may not be comfortable with a Console Application.
* __A proper support system in place__ . CSMark needs a proper support sysyem in place such as a forum or dedicated email address. CSMark could benefit from a website as well. The Discord server created could work as a form of support but it would require more users to be practical for people to use to get support.

### Name
CSMark 2.0

### Work In Progress Features
