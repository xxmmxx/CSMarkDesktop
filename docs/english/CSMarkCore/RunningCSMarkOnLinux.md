## Running CSMarkDesktop on Linux
Before you proceed, please check that your distro is supported.

### Installing
* You'll have to download the CSMark ``linux-x64`` or ``linux-arm`` packages from the latest release pages.
* Once it's downloaded, move the zip file to wherever you want it to run CSMark from.
* Extract the zip file
* Navigate inside the ``publish`` folder.
* You should see a file named ``CSMark`` without any file extension. Give it permission to run as an executable. You can do this through the file manager GUI or through the terminal.

* Finally, ``cd`` to wherever the publish folder is and run CSMark from the terminal  by entering ``./CSMark``

Your output should look something like this:
