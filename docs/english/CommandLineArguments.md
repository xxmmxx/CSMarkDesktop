## Command Line Arguments
This page documents what command line arguments can be used with CSMark CLI.

Failing to implement parameters in the correct order may cause the program to not recognize the parameter.

**Note:** When starting CSMark from another application, it should be noted that CSMark will take 3 seconds to display the License Agreement in the Console. The program will respond after the 3 seconds + the time taken to check for updates.
